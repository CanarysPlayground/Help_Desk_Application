# Agents in SDLC Workshop - Exercises

## 🎯 About This Workshop

This hands-on workshop teaches you how to integrate **AI-powered agents** throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) using **GitHub Copilot CLI**. You'll learn to automate coding tasks, plan features, build CI/CD workflows, and implement self-healing systems—all using natural language prompts with AI agents.

### The Application: Help Desk CRM
The Help Desk CRM is a ticketing system that manages customer support requests through a web interface. Customers can be registered with their contact information, and support tickets can be created with varying severity levels (low, medium, high, critical). The application provides a complete REST API for CRUD operations on customers and tickets, with automatic API documentation. Built with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, it follows a layered repository pattern architecture for maintainability and scalability.



**Key Features:**
- ✅ Customer management (CRUD operations)
- ✅ Ticket management with severity levels
- ✅ RESTful API with auto-generated documentation
- ✅ Web-based frontend interface
- ✅ Layered architecture (Routes → Services → Repositories → Models)
